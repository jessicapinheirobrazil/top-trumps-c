## Top Trumps City - C Version

This is a beginner-level C programming exercise that simulates a simplified version of the “Top Trumps” card game.

The program collects data from the user to create two city cards. Each card stores attributes such as:

- State
- City name

- GDP (PIB)

The objective is to practice handling strings, numerical input/output, and basic formatting in C.

### Features

- Formatted data display
- Floating-point formatting (2 decimal places)
- Manual input for 2 cards (no loops)

### Language

- Written in C
- Compatible with GCC and most C compilers
